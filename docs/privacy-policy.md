# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 31, 2025**

## Introduction

Gemini Keyboard Shortcuts ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

The Extension does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit:

- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- Your conversations with Google Gemini
- Browsing history
- Cookies or tracking data
- Analytics or usage statistics
- Any data to external servers

### What We Store Locally

The Extension stores only:

- **Shortcut Preferences**: Your customized keyboard shortcut configurations
- **Extension State**: Whether the extension is enabled/disabled

This data is stored using your browser's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API, which:
- Keeps data local to your browser
- Syncs across your devices if you're signed into Chrome
- Is never accessible to us or any third party

## Permissions Explained

### `storage`
Used to save your keyboard shortcut preferences. This data stays in your browser and syncs via your Google account if enabled.

### Host Permission: `*://gemini.google.com/*`
Required to inject the keyboard shortcut functionality into the Gemini website. The extension only runs on gemini.google.com and nowhere else.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review our code at any time to verify our privacy practices:

## Summary
